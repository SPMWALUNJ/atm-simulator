The simulator uses a class-based approach, where the ATM is represented by an instance of the ATM class. The class has attributes for the balance and methods for each of the above-mentioned functionalities.
The simulator also includes a main function that creates an instance of the ATM class and provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the ATM.
Requirements:

Features:
- Deposit money into the account
- Withdraw money from the account (if sufficient balance is available)
- Check the current balance
